# Implementation of pocketsphinx Speech Recognition based on a grammar.
# It requires a dictionary of world and a grammar file. There are also
# methods for audio recording (based on linux arecord) and file format
# conversion (based on linux sox, lame, oggenc)

    Spynx is based on some standard file that it is necessary to provide:
    
    1- JSpeech Grammar extension (JSF): platform-independent, vendor-independent textual representation of 
    grammars for use in speech recognition. Grammars are used by speech recognizers to determine 
    what the recognizer should listen for, and so describe the utterances a user may say. 
    JSGF adopts the style and conventions of the Java Programming Language in addition to use of 
    traditional grammar notations.
    Example:
        grammar hello;
        public <greet> = (good morning | hello) ( bhiksha | evandro | paul | philip | rita | will );
    http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/doc/sphinx4/edu/cmu/sphinx/jsgf/JSGFGrammar.html
    2- A dictionary of allowed words, all the words used in the grammar must be present in this file.
    3- The model for the language, the Pocketsphinx default en-us folder is a good choice.
